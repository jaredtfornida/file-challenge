# You are developing a bug tracking software

# The challenge here is to feed each item into the correct place in the file structure

The file structure should look as so:

Tasks/<Module>/<Class>/<Assignment>.json

- Semester should look like: [Fall|Spring]-YYYY EXAMPLE: Fall-2022
- Class should look like: [Name] EXAMPLE: BCIS-2710
- Assignment should look: [Name].json with contents inside

Write a script that organizes each file into the correct place.
